## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a To-Do List board that allows users to create and organize tasks by project, improving productivity.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Next.js to further my understanding of modern web development frameworks.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™ve been collaborating on a coding habit tracker app that uses a virtual pet to motivate (emotionally manipulate) users to keep the pet "charged" by completing their study goals, making the process more engaging and fun.
